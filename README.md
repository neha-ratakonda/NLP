##### Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment analysis of headlines for stock market forecasts aims to identify the emotional tone reflected in financial news headlines. Through the identification and analysis of positive, negative, and neutral attitudes included in the textual data, the research seeks to forecast trends in the stock market. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract important keywords and phrases from headlines and then weighs them according to their relevance to the performance of the stock market. The main objective is to use ideas acquired in the area, like sentiment analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, to forecast market movements with high accuracy. To ensure responsible and objective use in the context of financial decision-making, the project takes into account both the technological and ethical elements of natural language processing.
